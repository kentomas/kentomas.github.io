## Sample

You can use Fluentd in your Java application by using the Fluentd Java logger library, which is a Fluentd plugin that enables you to send logs from your Java application to Fluentd.

Here are the steps to use Fluentd in your Java application:

1. Add the Fluentd Java logger dependency to your project. You can do this by adding the following Maven dependency to your pom.xml file:

    ```xml title="pom.xml"
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.fluentd</groupId>
        <artifactId>fluent-logger-java</artifactId>
        <version>0.4.0</version>
    </dependency>
    ```

2. Initialize the Fluentd logger in your Java code. You can do this by creating a FluentLogger instance and passing the Fluentd host and port as parameters:

    ```java
    import org.fluentd.logger.FluentLogger;

    public class MyApp {
        private static FluentLogger logger = FluentLogger.getLogger("myapp", "fluentd-host", 24224);

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            logger.log("mytag", "Hello Fluentd!");
        }
    }
    ```

3. Run your Java application and check the Fluentd logs. You should see the logs sent from your Java application in the Fluentd logs.

That's it! You can now use Fluentd to collect and manage logs from your Java application. You can also customize the Fluentd logger to fit your specific needs by using various configuration options and plugins available in Fluentd.
