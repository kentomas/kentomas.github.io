# Harbor

## Overview

Harbor is an open-source container image registry that can be used with Kubernetes. It provides a secure and scalable platform for storing, signing, and distributing Docker images.

In a Kubernetes environment, Harbor can be used as a central repository for container images, enabling developers to store and share images between clusters, teams, and organizations. It also provides features such as role-based access control (RBAC), vulnerability scanning, and image replication to ensure the security and reliability of the images stored in the registry.

Harbor is designed to be highly available and scalable, with support for horizontal scaling and multi-master replication. It also provides an API and web interface for managing images, repositories, and users, making it easy to integrate with Kubernetes and other container orchestration platforms.

Overall, Harbor is a powerful tool for managing container images in Kubernetes environments, providing a secure and scalable solution for storing and distributing container images across multiple teams and clusters.

## Example

An example of how Harbor can be used in a Kubernetes environment:

1. Install Harbor: First, you'll need to install Harbor on your Kubernetes cluster. You can do this using Helm or by deploying the Harbor chart directly using Kubernetes manifests. Once installed, Harbor will provide a web interface for managing images and repositories.

2. Push images to Harbor: Once Harbor is installed, you can start pushing container images to it. You can do this using the Docker CLI, or by configuring your CI/CD pipeline to push images to Harbor automatically. When you push an image to Harbor, it will be stored securely in the Harbor registry.

3. Configure Kubernetes to use Harbor: Next, you'll need to configure your Kubernetes cluster to use Harbor as the default registry for pulling images. You can do this by creating a Kubernetes secret containing your Harbor credentials, and then referencing this secret in your Kubernetes deployment YAML files.

4. Use images from Harbor: Finally, you can use the images stored in Harbor in your Kubernetes deployments. When you deploy an application, Kubernetes will automatically pull the required images from Harbor and start the containers.

For example, let's say you have a web application that consists of multiple containers, including a web server and a database. You can build and push the Docker images for each container to Harbor, and then deploy the application to Kubernetes using a YAML file that references the images stored in Harbor.

By using Harbor as a central registry for your container images, you can ensure that all images are stored securely in a central location, and that they can be easily shared and used across different teams and clusters. You can also use Harbor's RBAC and vulnerability scanning features to ensure that only authorized users can access and deploy images, and that images are free from security vulnerabilities.
