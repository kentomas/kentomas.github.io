# Helm

## Overview

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes, which is a popular open-source container orchestration system used in modern software development. Helm helps developers and operators package, configure, and deploy Kubernetes applications easily and efficiently.

Helm uses charts, which are collections of YAML files that describe a Kubernetes application's structure, dependencies, and metadata. Charts can include templates, which are used to generate Kubernetes manifests for deploying and configuring the application. Charts can be easily shared and reused, making it easier for developers to collaborate on Kubernetes projects.

Using Helm, developers can quickly install and upgrade Kubernetes applications, roll back changes, and manage complex multi-tier applications. Helm also provides a way to manage application dependencies and install required components automatically. This makes it easier to manage the complexity of large-scale Kubernetes deployments.

Overall, Helm is a powerful tool for managing Kubernetes applications and infrastructure, helping developers and operators streamline their development and deployment workflows.

## Example using Helm

Here is an example of how Helm can be used to deploy a simple web application on Kubernetes:

1. First, you would create a Helm chart for your web application. This chart would include a set of YAML files that define the components of your application, such as deployment, service, and ingress resources. You would also include any configuration parameters that your application needs.
2. Once you have your Helm chart, you can use the `helm install` command to deploy the chart onto your Kubernetes cluster. For example, you might run the following command to install the chart:

    ```sh
    helm install myapp ./myapp-chart
    ```

    This command would install the chart located in the `myapp-chart` directory and name the release `myapp`.

3. After the deployment is complete, you can use the `kubectl get` command to view the status of your Kubernetes resources, like so:

    ```sh
    kubectl get pods,svc,ingress
    ```

    This command would show you the status of your application's pods, services, and ingress resources.

4. If you need to update your application, you can modify the chart files and run the `helm upgrade` command. For example, you might run the following command to upgrade your chart:

    ```sh
    helm upgrade myapp ./myapp-chart
    ```

5. Finally, if you need to remove your application from the cluster, you can use the `helm uninstall` command. For example, you might run the following command to uninstall your chart:

    ```sh
    helm uninstall myapp
    ```

    This command would delete all of the Kubernetes resources associated with your application.
