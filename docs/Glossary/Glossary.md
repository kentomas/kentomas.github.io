# Glossary

## Aggregate

A cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit.

## CORS - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

It is a mechanism that allows a web page from one domain to make requests to a different domain, typically with JavaScript. This is done by adding specific headers to the HTTP request and response, which indicate which origin is allowed to make the request and which methods are allowed. CORS is used to secure web applications from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, and to allow web applications to access resources from different domains.

## Immutable

Unable to be changed.

## Ubiquitous Language
