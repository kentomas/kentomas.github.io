# Glossary

## Aggregate

A cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit.

## CORS - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

It is a mechanism that allows a web page from one domain to make requests to a different domain, typically with JavaScript.

This is done by adding specific headers to the HTTP request and response, which indicate which origin is allowed to make the request and which methods are allowed. CORS is used to secure web applications from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, and to allow web applications to access resources from different domains.

## Immutable

Unable to be changed.

## Service Principal

A Service Principal is an identity created for use by applications or services within a Microsoft Azure subscription.

It allows the application or service to authenticate to Azure resources and perform actions with the permissions granted to the principal. This allows for more granular control over access to Azure resources, as permissions can be granted or revoked for a specific Service Principal, rather than for an entire user or service.

## Ubiquitous Language

A ubiquitous language is a vocabulary shared by everyone involved in a project, from domain experts to stakeholders, to project managers, to developers.
