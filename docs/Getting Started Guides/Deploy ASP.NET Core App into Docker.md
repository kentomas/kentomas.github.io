# Deploy ASP.NET Core App into Docker

## Overview

In recent years, enterprises are choosing microservices over monolithic for their large consumer applications to meet user demand, increase scalability and availability. In this episode, Nish Anil will take you through Microservices concepts, what are containers and how they're relevant. You will learn to build your first Microservices endpoint in .NET, containerize it and run them locally within 30 mins.

07:22 - Docker Architecture
08:01 - Containers vs Virtual Machines
08:49 - What is an Orchestrator/Kubernetes?
09:33 - Demo: Build a Microservice endpoint in .NET
13:56 - Dockerfile explanation
16:14 - Common Docker error - the docker daemon is not running
17:51 - What are Docker multi-stage builds?
19:58 - Run multiple containers locally using Docker-Compose

## What are Microservices?

- Highlight Maintainable and Testable
- Loosely Coupled
- Organised Around Business Capabilities
  - Use DDD to identify the business contexts
- Owned by a Small Team
- Independently deployable
