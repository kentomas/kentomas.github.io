# Database Migrations

## Java

### What is the recommended database migration framework using java, spring boot and MySQL?

There are several database migration frameworks available for Java Spring Boot applications. Two popular choices are `Flyway` and `Liquibase`.

`Flyway` is a lightweight database migration framework that is easy to set up and integrates well with Spring Boot. It uses SQL-based migrations that allow you to manage your database schema using plain SQL scripts. `Flyway` tracks the current state of your database schema and applies migrations in a controlled and consistent way, ensuring that your database stays in sync with your application as you make changes.

`Liquibase` is another popular database migration framework that provides more advanced features than Flyway, such as support for XML, YAML, and JSON-based migration scripts. `Liquibase` also allows you to manage complex database schema changes, such as renaming tables and columns, and provides a rich set of built-in change types for handling common schema changes.

Both `Flyway` and `Liquibase` are compatible with MySQL and integrate well with Spring Boot. The choice between them will depend on your specific needs and preferences. If you prefer a lightweight framework that uses SQL-based migrations, `Flyway` may be the best choice for you. If you need more advanced features or prefer a more flexible approach to managing database schema changes, `Liquibase` may be the better choice.
