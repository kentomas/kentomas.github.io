# Azure Log Analytics Workspace

A Log Analytics Workspace can be used to collect, analyze, and visualize data from multiple Azure resources and services, as well as from on-premises resources and other cloud services. It is not specific to one particular Azure app.

You can create multiple Log Analytics Workspaces if you want to separate data collection and analysis for different environments, such as production, development, and test, or if you have different teams working on different projects and need to keep their data separate.

A single Log Analytics Workspace can also be used to collect data from multiple Azure apps, as well as other resources. This can be useful if you have multiple apps that are part of the same project or if you want to analyze data across different apps to gain insights into your overall environment.

Overall, the use case for Log Analytics Workspace is to be used as a central location for storing and analyzing log data from multiple resources and services, whether it is from one Azure app or multiple apps.
