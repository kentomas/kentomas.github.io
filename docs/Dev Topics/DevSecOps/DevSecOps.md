# DevSecOps

## Overview

DevSecOps is a software development approach that emphasizes the integration of security practices into the software development process, with the aim of improving security and reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities.

The term "DevSecOps" is derived from the combination of "Development", "Security", and "Operations". In traditional software development approaches, security is often treated as an afterthought, with security measures being implemented after the development process is complete. DevSecOps, on the other hand, advocates for the integration of security practices throughout the entire software development process, from planning and design to coding, testing, and deployment.

The goal of DevSecOps is to create a culture of shared responsibility for security, in which all stakeholders in the software development process, including developers, operations teams, and security professionals, work together to ensure that security is built into the software from the ground up. This approach helps to identify and address security vulnerabilities early in the development process, before they can be exploited by attackers.

DevSecOps relies on a range of tools and practices, including automated security testing, continuous integration and delivery, and the use of secure coding techniques and standards. By integrating these practices into the development process, DevSecOps aims to create more secure software, reduce the risk of security breaches, and improve the overall quality and reliability of software products.
