# Converting .NET Framework libraries to .NET Standard

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-migrate-from-dotnet-framework-to-dotnet-standard

- .NET Core

    The latest .NET implementation, open source and available for multiple operating systems. With .NET Core, you can build cross-platform console apps and ASP.NET Core Web applications and cloud services.

- .NET Standard

    The set of fundamental APIs, sometimes referred to as the .NET Base Class Library (BCL) that all .NET implementations must implement. By targeting .NET Standard, you can build libraries that you can share across all your .NET apps, no matter on which .NET implementation or operating system they run.

- Use .NET Portability Analyzer to determine what changes need to be made in libraries in order to convert.
