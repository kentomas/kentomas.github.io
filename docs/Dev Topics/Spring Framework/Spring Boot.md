# Spring Boot

## Entity

In Java Spring Boot, an entity is a class that represents a persistent object or a table in a database. Entities are typically used in object-relational mapping (ORM) frameworks like Hibernate to map the database tables to Java classes.

In Spring Boot, entities are typically defined as Java classes annotated with the @Entity annotation, which indicates that the class is a persistent entity. The class typically contains fields that map to columns in the database table, as well as getter and setter methods for accessing and modifying the data.

For example, if you have a `users` table in your database, you could define a User entity class that maps to that table. Here's an example:

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "users")
public class User {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    private Long id;

    private String name;
    private String email;
    
    // getter and setter methods
}
```

In this example:

- The `@Entity` annotation indicates that this class is a persistent entity.
- The `@Table` annotation specifies the name of the database table that this entity maps to.
- The `@Id` annotation indicates that the id field is the primary key for this entity.
- The `@GeneratedValue` annotation specifies that the primary key should be generated automatically.
    - The `GenerationType.AUTO` `strategy` indicates that the persistence provider should automatically choose an appropriate strategy based on the underlying database.
    - When you use `GenerationType.AUTO`, the persistence provider (usually Hibernate) will choose a primary key generation strategy based on the database you are using.
        - If you are using `MySQL`, Hibernate will use the `IDENTITY` `strategy`, which relies on an auto-incrementing column to generate primary key values.
        - If you are using `PostgreSQL`, Hibernate will use the `SEQUENCE` `strategy`, which relies on a sequence to generate primary key values.
        - Using `GenerationType.AUTO` is convenient because it allows you to write database-independent code that will work with different databases.
- The `name` and `email` fields map to columns in the users table.
