# C# Developer

As a C# developer, there are several key concepts and technologies that you should be familiar with in order to effectively use the language and build robust applications:

1. `Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts`: C# is an object-oriented language, so understanding the basics of OOP such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism is essential.
2. `LINQ and Lambda Expressions`: LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is a powerful feature in C# that allows you to write SQL-like queries over in-memory data collections. You should also be familiar with lambda expressions, which are anonymous functions that can be used with LINQ.
3. `ASP.NET`: C# is commonly used to build web applications using ASP.NET, a framework for building web applications and services. You should be familiar with the basics of building web applications using ASP.NET, such as how to create a website, handle requests, and respond with dynamic content.
4. `ADO.NET and Entity Framework`: ADO.NET is the data access technology in the .NET framework, and Entity Framework is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool that provides a convenient way to interact with databases in a more object-oriented way.
5. `WPF and UWP`: WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) and UWP (Universal Windows Platform) are used to build desktop and Windows Store applications, respectively. Understanding how to create a UI, handle user input, and interact with the underlying system is important for building Windows applications.
6. `.NET Core`: .NET Core is an open-source, cross-platform version of the .NET framework that can be used to build applications for Windows, Linux, and macOS. Understanding how to build, test, and deploy applications using .NET Core is important for developing cross-platform applications.
7. `Design patterns`: Familiarity with common design patterns such as the Model-View-Controller (MVC), Singleton, and Factory patterns can help you write cleaner, more maintainable code.
8. `Debugging and testing`: You should be familiar with how to use the debugging tools in Visual Studio, and understand the importance of writing automated tests for your code.
9. `Source control`: Familiarity with source control systems such as Git is important for working in team environments and for managing versioning of your code.
