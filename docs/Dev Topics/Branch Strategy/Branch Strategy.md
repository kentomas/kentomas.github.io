## Workflows

**Source:** https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow

1. Gitflow Workflow (preferred)
      - Branches:
        - main
        - develop
        - release
        - feature
        - hotfix
2. Centralized Workflow
      - A.K.A Trunk-based development
      - One branch to rule them all.
      - Use feature toggles to enable/disable incomplete features.
3. Feature Branch Workflow
4. Forking Workflow
