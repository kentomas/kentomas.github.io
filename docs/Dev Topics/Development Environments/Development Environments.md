# Development Environments

In software development, there are several types of deployment environments, including:

1. `Development`: This is the environment used by developers to write and test code.
2. `Test`: This environment is used to test the software before it is released to production.
3. `Staging`: This is a replica of the production environment used to test the software in a production-like setting before it is released to the public.
4. `Production`: This is the environment where the software is made available to end-users.
5. `Disaster Recovery`: This environment is used to restore the production environment in case of a disaster or outage.
6. `Sandbox`: This environment is used for testing and experimentation, it's typically isolated from the other environments and it's not meant for production use.

Note that different organizations may use different names for their deployment environments, and the specifics of each environment will depend on the organization's needs and infrastructure.

## Differences

### Staging vs Testing

The main difference between a test environment and a staging environment is their `purpose` and level of `similarity to the production` environment.

A test environment is typically used to test the functionality and performance of the software before it is released to production. It is usually set up on a separate server or network and is not identical to the production environment. It is used to test the software in a controlled environment, and any bugs or issues found are addressed before the software is deployed in a staging environment.

A staging environment, on the other hand, is a replica of the production environment and is used to test the software in a production-like setting. This environment is as close as possible to the production environment, and it's often used for final testing and validation before the software is deployed to the production environment. The goal is to ensure that the software will work seamlessly when it is released to the public, and to identify any issues that could arise in the production environment.

In summary, test environment is used for initial testing and debugging, while staging environment is used for final testing and validation before deployment to production.
