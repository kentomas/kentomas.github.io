# OO Design Principles

## SOLID

SOLID design principles of object-oriented programming:

- The `[S]ingle-responsibility principle`:
    - "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change. In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.
- The `[O]penâ€“closed principle`:
    - "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
- The `[L]iskov substitution principle`:
    - "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.
- The `[I]nterface` segregation principle:
    - "Clients should not be orced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use."
- The `[D]ependency` inversion principle:
    - "Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."
