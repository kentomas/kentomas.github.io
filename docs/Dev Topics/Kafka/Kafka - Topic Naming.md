# Kafka - Topic Naming

## Channels

People often name their Kafka topics with `input` or `output` to provide a clear indication of the direction of data flow.

In Kafka, topics act as channels for data that is produced and consumed by different applications. By naming a topic `input`, it signals that it's intended for data ingestion or input into the system. Similarly, naming a topic `output` signals that it's intended for data egress or output from the system.

This naming convention can be particularly useful when working with stream processing applications or data pipelines, where there may be multiple topics and complex data flows. By naming topics with clear and descriptive names, it can help developers and stakeholders understand the data flow and make it easier to reason about the system as a whole.

Overall, naming topics with `input` or `output` can be a useful convention to provide clarity and consistency in naming Kafka topics, particularly in complex data processing environments.

Here's an example of how naming Kafka topics with `input` or `output` can provide clarity in a data processing pipeline:

Let's say we have a system that receives data from multiple sources and processes it before sending it to a database for storage. In this system, we might have the following Kafka topics:

- `input-data-source-1`: This topic is named with `input` to indicate that it's intended for data ingestion from `data-source-1`.
- `input-data-source-2`: This topic is named with `input` to indicate that it's intended for data ingestion from `data-source-2`.
- `raw-data`: This topic is named to indicate that it contains raw data from both `data-source-1` and `data-source-2`. This topic could be used for data normalization, validation, and other processing steps.
- `processed-data`: This topic is named with `output` to indicate that it contains processed data that is ready for storage. This topic could contain data that has been transformed, aggregated, or otherwise processed in some way.
- `database-writer`: This topic is named with `output` to indicate that it's intended for data egress or output from the system. This topic could contain data that is ready for storage in a database or other data store.

In this example, the naming convention provides a clear indication of the direction of data flow, and helps to distinguish between topics that are intended for data input, processing, or output. This can make it easier to understand the system as a whole, and can help to ensure that data flows correctly through the pipeline.
