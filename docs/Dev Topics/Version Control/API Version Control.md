# API Version Control

!!! question

    If the api your api is calling changes version, should you update your api version?

!!! answer

    It depends on the changes made to the API that your API is calling. If the changes are backwards-compatible, then you may not need to update your API version. However, if the changes are not backwards-compatible, then you should update your API version to ensure that your API continues to function correctly and to avoid any potential errors. Additionally, updating your API version can also provide new functionality that your API can take advantage of.
