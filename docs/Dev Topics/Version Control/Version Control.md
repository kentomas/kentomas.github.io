# Version Control

## Semantic Versioning

Semantic Versioning (SemVer) is a widely used standard for version numbering of software libraries and applications. It uses a simple format of "`major`.`minor`.`patch`" (e.g. `v1.2.1`) to indicate the level of changes in a release.

The key principles of semantic versioning are:

- The `major` version number is incremented when there are breaking changes.
- The `minor` version number is incremented when new functionality is added in a backwards-compatible manner.
- The `patch` number is incremented when backwards-compatible bug fixes are made.

This way, users of your library or application can easily determine the level of changes in a release and take appropriate action, such as updating their code to account for breaking changes or taking advantage of new functionality.
